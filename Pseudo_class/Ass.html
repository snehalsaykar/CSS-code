                Vikram Batra was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honour on 15 August 1999, the
                52nd anniversary of India's independence. His father G.L. Batra received the honour for his deceased son
                from the President of India, the late K. R. Narayanan.[89]
                <br>

                The Param Vir Chakra citation reads as follows:
                <br>
                <h3> CITATION
                    <br>
                    CAPTAIN VIKRAM BATRA
                    <br>
                    13 JAMMU AND KASHMIR RIFLES (IC 57556)
                </h3>
                <br>
                During 'Operation Vijay', on 20 June 1999, Captain Vikram Batra, Commander Delta Company was tasked to
                attack Point 5140. Captain Batra with his company skirted around the feature from the East and
                maintaining surprise reached within assaulting distance of the enemy. Captain Batra reorganised his
                grave injuries, he crawled towards the enemy and hurled grenades clearing the position with utter
                disregard to his personal safety, leading from the front, he rallied his men and pressed on the attack
                and achieved a near impossible military task in the face of heavy enemy fire. The officer, however,
                succumbed to his injuries. Inspired by his daredevil act, his troops fell upon the enemy with vengeance,
                annihilated them and captured Point 4875.
                <br>
                Captain Vikram Batra, thus, displayed the most conspicuous personal bravery and leadership of the
                highest order in the face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice in the highest traditions of the
                Indian Army.
